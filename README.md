## Exploring alternatives for emissions factor calculations  


I submitted an entry to a Kaggle contest and this repository contains the work that I completed for my entry.  I am cleaning up the code and providing some additional documentation in case the approach is useful for future projects.  

The goal was to calculate an emissions factor for power plants in a sub-national region using data collected with satellite remote sensors.
